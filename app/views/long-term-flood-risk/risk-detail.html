                <p>
                    High risk means that each year this area has a chance of flooding of greater than 3.3%.
                  This takes into account the effect of any flood defences in the area.
                  These defences reduce, but do not completely stop the chance of flooding as they can be overtopped, or fail.

                <p>
                    High risk means that each year this area has a chance of flooding of greater than 3.3%. Flooding from surface water is difficult to predict because local features can greatly affect the chance and severity of flooding. Because of this, we report the highest risk within 20m of a specific location, such as an individual property. This means reports for neighbouring properties may show different levels of risk.
