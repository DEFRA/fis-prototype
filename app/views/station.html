          <div class="panel panel-border-narrow">

            <p>The Environment agency uses a network of monitoring stations across the country. Each one has its own datum - a height in metres fixed relative to mean sea level. This height is expressed as metres above ordnance datum (mAOD). The river levels we provide for each monitoring station are all relative to its site datum.</p>

            <p>If we didn't do this, we'd show some very high measurements, which could cause confusion. By using a local site datum, the river levels are easier to understand, especially by users familiar with the data from a particular monitoring station.</p>

            <p>A river's height above ordnance datum can be seen by adding the site datum to the river level.</p>

            <p>The data we collect is fed into this service once or twice a day under typical conditions. We increase this frequency whenever there's a greater risk of flooding.</p>

          <summary><span class="summary">How are forecast levels produced?</span></summary>

          <div class="panel panel-border-narrow">

            <p>The forecast levels shown here are computer model predictions based on data and information including the Met Officeâ€™s rainfall forecasts and observed river levels. The coastal forecast levels are also based on predicted tide and wind information from the Met Office and other organisations.</p>

            <h3 class="heading-small">What's behind our forecasts?</h3>
            <p>The Environment Agency considers many things when producing its forecasts. These include the amount of rain that's fallen in the last few days and whether more is expected.</p><p>
            </p><p>It also looks at likely ground conditions, together with wind, tides and wave height.</p>
            <p>When the predicted conditions and river or sea levels combine to threaten flooding, forecasters issue flood alerts or, much more seriously, flood warnings.</p>
